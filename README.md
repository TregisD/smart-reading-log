# Goal
- I want to create a dashboard that keeps track of the books you read using Power BI. This will also provide data on how long it takes to read a book (on average, by page), which genre you enjoy the most, and more. I will be adding a rating system to keep track of how much one likes a book. The rating system will contain five sub-categories: Story & Pacing, Characters & Development, Writing Style, Themes & Depth, and Emotional Impact & Enjoyment. This system will allow more in-depth analysis of how one rates a book. This will, in turn, help me achieve my second goal. 
- I want to create a recommender system based on the books you've read and liked. It will examine the overall rating (the average of the five sub-categories) you provided, the genre, the number of pages, and any other relevant factors I can think of.
