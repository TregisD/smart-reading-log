# smart-reading-log

## Overview
This project will combine creating a personal dashboard to keep track of books you enjoy, as well as provide analysis on data that can be retrieved from the information input, and a machine learning recommender system to provide insights and actionable recommendations from [book dataset that has yet to be decided].

It is designed to showcase both:
* Analytical storytelling using Power BI.
* Recommender system modeling in Python.


## Part 1: Business Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
I want to create a dashboard that tracks the books you read using Power BI. This will also provide analytics on data such as how long it takes to read a book (on average, by page), which genre you enjoy the most, and more. I will be adding a rating system to keep track of how much one likes a book. The rating system will contain five sub-categories: Story & Pacing, Characters & Development, Writing Style, Themes & Depth, and Emotional Impact & Enjoyment. This system will allow more in-depth analysis of how one rates a book.

## Part 2: Recommender System (Python)
I want to create a recommender system based on the books you've read and liked. It will examine the overall rating (the average of the five sub-categories) you provided, the genre, the number of pages, and any other relevant factors I can think of.
